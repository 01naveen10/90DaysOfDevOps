# Introduction - Day 1

Welcome to the #90DaysOfDevOps Challenge with the #TrainWithShubham Community! Today, we begin our journey into the world of DevOps. Hereâ€™s what you need to do:

1. **Fork this Repository:**
   - Go to the repository on GitHub and fork it to your own account. This will allow you to track your progress and contribute.

2. **Start with a DevOps Roadmap:**

3. **Write a LinkedIn Post or a Small Article:**
   - Share your understanding of DevOps based on the video and your research. Cover the following points:
     - **What is DevOps:**
       - DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
     - **What is Automation, Scaling, and Infrastructure:**
       - **Automation:** The use of technology to perform tasks without human intervention. In DevOps, this includes automated testing, deployment, and infrastructure management.
       - **Scaling:** The ability to increase or decrease IT resources as needed to meet changing demand. This can be vertical (adding more power to existing machines) or horizontal (adding more machines).
       - **Infrastructure:** The foundational technology and systems that support the development, deployment, and operation of applications. This includes servers, networks, storage, and more.
     - **Why DevOps is Important:**
       - DevOps enhances collaboration between development and operations teams, leading to faster and more reliable software delivery.
       - It improves efficiency through automation and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
       - DevOps practices ensure better quality control and quicker issue resolution, which enhances overall product quality and customer satisfaction.

4. **Engage with the Community:**
   - Share your LinkedIn post or article link in the community forum or on social media using the hashtags #90DaysOfDevOps and #TrainWithShubham.
   - Read and comment on posts from other participants to foster a collaborative learning environment.
